Of all the human senses, vision is the richest in content and perhaps the hardest to formalise in a rigorous manner. As a discipline, Computer Vision covers a wide variety of methods for interpretation and analysis of visual data using a computer. In this course we will present a broad, introductory survey of the field. The objective of the course is to develop a familiarity with the approaches to modelling and solving problems in computer vision. Mathematical modelling and algorithmic solutions for vision tasks will be emphasised.

We shall endeavour to cover the following topics :

Image Formation : Camera Geometry, Radiometry, Colour; \
Image Features : Points, Lines, Edges, Contours, Texture; \
Shape : Object Geometry, Stereo, Shape from cues; \
Motion : Calibration, Registration, Multiview Geometry, Optical Flow; \
Approaches to Grouping and Segmentation; \
Representation and Methods for Object Recognition; \
Applications : Novel image sensing, Mining internet images 

This course has no pre-requisities. However, familiarity with linear algebra and probability theory will be useful. Programming assignments will be implemented in Matlab, familiarity with C is helpful.

Grading Policy:- \
Mid Term 1: 20 marks\
Mid Term 2: 30 marks \
End Term  : 50 marks
